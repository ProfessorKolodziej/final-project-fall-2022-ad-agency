	<h2 class="about">About the Database</h2>
		<p>Advertising lives in the greater funnel of marketing as one of its most creative functionalities. There are thousands of agencies in advertising and many agencies overlap from marketing. As a result, the advertising industry is constantly changing with new forms of specializations and capabilities, so the lists are ever-growing.
		<p>AdBase (as of December 2022) is a database designed to filter top advertising agencies across industries, specialties, and demographics based in the US. We researched agencies from top grossing to award winning to provide a diverse representation of the industry.</p>
		<p>AdBase was created by aspiring agency professionals sifting through Google, blogs, and ‘top lists’ to create a hot list of agencies in pursuit of internships and jobs. We struggled to find a single platform that categorized an encompassing sampling of advertising agencies in the US. And so, we came up with AdBase.  We wish you the best of luck in your search!</p>			
			<p>*This database was sorted by undergraduate seniors supported by professors and professionals.*</p>
